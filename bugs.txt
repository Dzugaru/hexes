- Can't change material color from native-managed callback

- Player walks on place very rarely (and sometimes walking animation doesnt start, mecanim problems?)

- If path is null - stop calculating it every frame (for mob)
- Mob walks from one tile to another while spell moves from another tile to prev one - no damage
