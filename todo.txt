- Proper stress test on a D engine at all times is a must!
- WEADZX controls (hexes ftw)
- Ranged mobs - modify pathfinding to support it
- Think about fixed update for engine - or some events may or may not be on the same tick depending on framerate

IDEAS:
- Light spheres (of different colors?) drifting above give magic power - (same - near tree - tree magic, near stone - stone magic,
after some uses tree withers)
